        <h2>HTML Character Entities</h2>

        <p>In HTML, entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a reserved meaning in HTML or cannot be typed directly. </p>
           <p>These entities begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). For example, &lt; represents the less-than sign (<), and &gt; represents the greater-than sign (>).</p> 
          <p>Entities are used to display characters like quotation marks (&quot;) or non-printable symbols that might otherwise interfere with the HTML code.</p>
          <p>They help ensure that special characters are rendered correctly in web pages.</p>
