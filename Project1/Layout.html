        <h2>The HTML layout</h2>

        <p> a layout refers to the arrangement of elements on a webpage. It defines how different content sections,
             <p>such as headers, paragraphs, images, and navigation menus, are positioned and structured.</p>
              <p>Layouts are typically created using HTML tags like div, header, footer, section, and others,</p>
                 <p>often in combination with CSS for styling and positioning. Modern web design relies on flexible layout techniques, </p>
                 <p>such as CSS Grid and Flexbox, to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
