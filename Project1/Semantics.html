        <h2>The Html semantics</h2>

        <p>HTML semantics refers to the use of HTML elements that have meaningful names and roles, which help define the structure and content of a webpage.
            <p>Semantic tags, such as header, footer, article, section, and nav,</p> 
                <p>provide better clarity for both developers and search engines. These elements improve accessibility, SEO, </p> 
                 <p>and maintainability by conveying the purpose of the content they enclose.</p>
                 <p>Using semantic HTML makes the webpage easier to understand and navigate for both humans and machines.</p>
